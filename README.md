C Programming Tasks

A repository for c university projects.

1A is a programm that checks if a given input is a palindrom. 
1B is a programm that searches for solutions for the 3-coloring-problem using separate processes,shared memory and semaphores.
1A and 1B contain some errors since it was my first time coding in C. 

2 is a program that multiplies two given hex numbers of equal even size using subprocesses and pipes for the inter process communication.

3 is a basic implementation of parts of the http protocol. (WIP)
